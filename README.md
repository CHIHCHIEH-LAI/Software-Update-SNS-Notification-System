# Software Update SNS Notification System

Using Terraform, AWS S3, Lambda, and SNS to manage and distribute software updates provides a scalable and efficient solution. Hereâ€™s how the system works:

1. `Upload`: When a new software package is uploaded to S3, it triggers a Lambda function.
2. `Notify`: The Lambda function sends a notification through SNS to all subscribed endpoints (email, Slack, etc.).
3. `Install`: Clients receive the notification, download the update, and install it.

Files:

1. `main.tf`: Contains core resources (S3, SNS, notifications).
2. `am.tf`: Contains IAM roles and policies.
3. `lambda.tf`: Contains Lambda function configuration.
4. `outputs.tf`: Contains output values.
5. `lambda_function.py`: Contains the Lambda function code.

Commands:

- `terraform init`
- `terraform plan`
- `terraform apply`
