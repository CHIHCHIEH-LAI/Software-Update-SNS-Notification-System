# Software Update SNS Notification System

Using Terraform, AWS S3, Lambda, and SNS to manage and distribute software updates provides a scalable and efficient solution. Hereâ€™s how the system works:

1. `Upload`: When a new software package is uploaded to S3, it triggers a Lambda function.
2. `Notify`: The Lambda function sends a notification through SNS to all subscribed endpoints (email, Slack, etc.).
3. `Install`: Clients receive the notification, download the update, and install it.

Commands:

- `terraform init`
- `terraform plan -out=plan`
- `terraform apply "plan"`
- `terraform destroy`
